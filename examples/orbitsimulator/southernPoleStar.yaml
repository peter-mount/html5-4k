# Example of an animation of the proper motion of stars:

#
# The Southern Pole star is not as simple. There is a lot more proper motion downstairs.
# Rather than stars sitting around waiting for the pole to point to them,
# the stars migrate into the path of the pole.
#
# Sirius will be the Southern Star twice in the next quarter million years.
